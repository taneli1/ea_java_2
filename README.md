The application was created by Max Bowen and Leevi Limnell.

This project was created for the Norofff backend course. The project took roughly 20 hours to complete.

## Functionality

The first part of the assignment was to create a superhero database.

All sql scripts can be found in the scripts folder

The second part of the assignment was to create an application to read data using JDBC.

The task was to create models based on the customer requirements:

After the necessary requirements we implemented a repository pattern using domain driven design(DDD) and tested the application with an AppRunner
